Time tracker

What is it?

This is a desktop application that can help you manage your time. TimeTracker runs in the background collecting information on the current applications that are open and are activily used. While the application is in use, you will visually see where most of your time is being spent on the computer.






TO ME:

What it needs to do :

    []  - Track each active application that is being used at application "start"
        [] - Sort each application in DESCENDING order (most used -> least used)
